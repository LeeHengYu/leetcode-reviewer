# Leetcode Reviewer

A front-end mini-project designed in React TypeScript. LeetCode solutions are in Python 3 or C++ (few).

You can visit the solutions on Github via [here](https://github.com/LeeHengYu/LeetCodeRevision).

## Why this repo exists??

Because I didn't get a job for 2023 summer and the recruting season for 2024 summer internship is imminent.

If I don't do something else in this summer, my CV would be empty af due to lack of working experience.

Having said that, the situation is still pretty dire because exp is way more important.

## Deployment

Still in progress...

## Inspiration

[NEETCODE](https://neetcode.io/practice) is pretty good.
