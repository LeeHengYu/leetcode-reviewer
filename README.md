## Description

The website contains the daily LeetCode challenge questions starting from June 1, 2023.

Users can filter questions based on categories and difficulties and via searching. The difficulty of each question may be altered based on my judgement.

## Current state of the project

MVP completed.

Todo:

1. More other questions
2. Routing to different pages
3. Filter by dates

## Why this project exists??

Because I didn't get a job for 2023 summer and the recruting season for 2024 summer internship is imminent.

If I don't do something else in this summer, my CV would be empty af due to lack of working experience.

Having said that, the situation is still pretty dire because exp is way more important.

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel

## Inspiration

[NEETCODE](https://neetcode.io/practice) is pretty good.
